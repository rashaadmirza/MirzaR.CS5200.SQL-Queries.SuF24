```{r}
# Load the DBI package, which provides a database interface definition for communication between R and DBMS
library(DBI)
# Load the RSQLite package
library(RSQLite)

# Connect to the OrdersDB.sqlitedb.db database in the current working directory
dbcon <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "OrdersDB.sqlitedb.db")

# Verify the connection by listing the tables in the database
tables <- dbListTables(dbcon)
print(tables)

# Disconnect from the database when done
# dbDisconnect(dbcon)
```

### 1. What are the last name, first name, and birth date of all employees, sorted by last name?

```{sql connection=dbcon}
-- the connection parameter within the {sql} chunk tells R Markdown which database connection to use for executing the SQL query

SELECT LastName, FirstName, BirthDate
FROM Employees
ORDER BY LastName;
```

### 2. What are the names of each category and the number of distinct products in that category?

```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT c.CategoryName, COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProductID) AS ProductCount
FROM Categories c
JOIN Products p ON c.CategoryID = p.CategoryID
GROUP BY c.CategoryName;
```

### 3. List the number of orders by customer ID and name, ordered from most to least, restricted to those customers who have placed at least one order.

```{sql connection=dbcon}

FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName

LIMIT 10;
```

### 6. How many employees never worked with a single customer, i.e., they appear in the Employees table but not in the Orders table?

```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT COUNT(e.EmployeeID) AS EmployeesWithoutOrders
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
WHERE o.OrderID IS NULL;
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT (CONCAT(e.FirstName, ' ', e.LastName)) AS EmployeesWithoutOrders, e.EmployeeID
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
WHERE o.OrderID IS NULL;

### 7. How many products contain either "Caviar" or "Kaviar" in the name of the product?

```{sql connection=dbcon}

```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE LOWER(ProductName) LIKE '%caviar%' OR LOWER(ProductName) LIKE '%kaviar%';
```

### 8. What is the total number of distinct countries to which at least one order was shipped?

```{sql connection=dbcon}

ORDER BY c.Country
LIMIT 10;

### 9. What is the total for each order, i.e., the amount that the customers is required to pay for the products at the ordered quantity in the order. List the order ID, the order date, the name of the customer, and the total cost.

```{sql connection=dbcon}

GROUP BY o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
ORDER BY o.OrderID
LIMIT 10;

  JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
  GROUP BY e.EmployeeID
  ORDER BY Sales DESC

WHERE Sales = (SELECT MAX(Sales) FROM EmpSales);
```

### 17. Which customers (name and ID) have never bought anything?

GROUP BY c.CategoryName;
```

### 19. What is the most recent order? List the order ID and the name, city, and country of the customer who placed it.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.Country) AS SupplierCountries

ORDER BY SupplierCountries
LIMIT 10;
```

```{r}
# Disconnect from the database when done
dbDisconnect(dbcon)
```

Note: As per the assignment instructions, many SQL chunks include the LIMIT 10 clause to restrict the result to 10 rows if the query results in more than 10 rows.
